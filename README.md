# CS240
This repository holds some of the projects I completed during my CS 240 - Data Structures and Algorithms class. All projects were done in Python and the documentation about Programming Assignments(PA) 2 - 5 can be found at https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/lam2mo/cs240_2014_08/assignments.html under "Programming Projects".
