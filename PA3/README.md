This project description can be found here https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/lam2mo/cs240_2014_08/pa03-skip_list.html. The purpose of 
this project was to create the "Set" class of python using different underlying data structures and then compare the speeds of
adding, removing, and searching.
array_set.py: Coded by one of my professors, this class mimics the Python Set class using python arrays. 
linked_list.py: Coded by Arlie Moore, this class mimics the Python Set class using a singly-linked list. 
run_comparison.py: Coded by one of my professors, this class runs time comparisons for add, remove, and search methods for array_set,
linked_list, and skip_set. 
skip_set.py: Coded by Arlie Moore and also the main class of this project. It mimics the Python set class using a data structure called
a skip list. Details on this data structure can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list. 
sorted_set_tests.py: Coded by my professor, used to test my implementation of the skip set.
